## Code

This folder contains detailed implementations of the approaches discussed in the paper.

### Implementations

1. `bcp.cpp` — Implements a greedy approach that schedules all tasks on the best Virtual Machines (VMs).
2. `lef.cpp` — Implements `Algorithm 1` and `Algorithm 2`.
3. `dy.cpp` — Implements `Algorithm 1` and `Algorithm 3`.
4. `dynamicApproach.cpp` — Implements `Algorithm 5`.
5. `rews.cpp` — Implements a state-of-the-art approach that considers *reliability* as the only hard constraint.
6. `remsm_dvfs.cpp` — Implements a state-of-the-art approach that considers *deadline* as the only hard constraint.
